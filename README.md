## About

Health context of years 2020-2021 as well as the rise of MOOCs in the online learning lead to a turning point for education. However, these new platforms raise constraints such as education dropout and learning new skills in order for students to be the master of their learning process and behavior.

This is why, during this master 2 Data science internship we decided to study deeper the concepts of Self-Regulated Learning and Artificial Intelligence apply to this sector. Our aim is to provide an accurate understanding of the main issues and to propose general solution which can be replicated on several platforms.

Between the line of Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics, our process begins from the creation of a gathering module (Log Events and Prompts) on the France IOI's platform. Then, we propose to study the gathered data and implement indicators linked to SRL. Moreover, we predict the SRL skills of student thanks to Dynamic Bayesian Networks.

Last but not least, we wish to propose accurate intervention based on previous results. These interventions can enable to avoid unwanted behaviors and reduce educational dropout.
